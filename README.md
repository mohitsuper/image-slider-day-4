✅ Image Slider – Day 4 | Zero to Hero Coding 🧠
🎯 Description:
On Day 4 of the Zero to Hero Coding Challenge, I built a smooth and responsive Image Slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps strengthen DOM manipulation skills, dynamic class handling, and event listeners.

🖼️ Features:

➡️/⬅️ Next & Previous button functionality
✨ Smooth sliding transitions
🖱️ Basic hover and click interaction
📱 Responsive design for all screens
🔁 Auto or manual image change logic (optional upgrade)

This image slider forms a solid base for real-world components like carousels, product showcases, or galleries.
